Having skills in organising, rearranging and summarising data is crucial for students and researchers in all sciences. On these pages, we give some guidance for data manipulation that can save a lot of time when it comes to analysing data and making effective figures. 

Data manipulation using the R packages [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html), [tidyr](https://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/22/introducing-tidyr/) and [reshape2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/).

* [Subsetting data](http://environmentalcomputing.net/subsetting-data/) - selecting rows and columns  
* [Summarising data](http://environmentalcomputing.net/summarising-data/) - extracting summary statistics  
* [Combining data sets](http://environmentalcomputing.net/combining-data-sets/) - joining entire data sets, or parts by matching rows
* [Reshaping data](http://environmentalcomputing.net/reshaping-data/) between wide and long formats
