Some simple hypothesis tests with the t statistic:

* [One sample t tests](http://environmentalcomputing.net/one-sample-t-test/) to contrasting a single sample parameter to a population parameter  
* [Independent samples](http://environmentalcomputing.net/independent-samples-t-test/) t tests to contrast the means of two samples
* [Paired t-tests](http://environmentalcomputing.net/paired-t-tests/) to contrast two groups of values where each pair is measured from the same object.
