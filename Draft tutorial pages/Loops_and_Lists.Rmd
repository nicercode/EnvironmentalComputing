<span style="color:red">Loops, lists and if/else statements
========================================================

Do you find yourself cutting and pasting R code a lot? 

This usually will create problems for yourself later.  One principle of good coding is to try and reduce repitition to the minimum possible.  There are two approaches/skills to both make your code organized and save you work.  The first one is [fucntions](http://environmentalcomputing.net/writing-simple-functions/) and the second one (covered below) is loops.  

We often want to do repetitive tasks in Ecology: we may like to loop through a list of files and do the same thing over and over. Be aware that there are many packages in `R` with functions that will do all of the hard work for you (e.g. check out `reshape`, `plyr` and `dplyr` covered [here](http://environmentalcomputing.net/summarising-data/)). The `dplyr` approach works well if your data is "tidy"--in a data frame--if your data is in many different files, then a loop may be a quicker solution.

## Basic loop syntax

The syntax of loops is relative simple. The essential components are `for(){}`, consider the loop below. The first time we run through the loop, the value *i* will be equal to 1, we will then do whatever task is within the `{}`, in this case, print the value of *i*, and then we will start again with *i* = 2, all the way up to *i = 10*.

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```

We can change the range of numbers (1:10) to anything we like, they don't have to be a sequence or integers, or even numbers. You can also change *i* to anything you like.

```{r}
nums <- c(3.2, 890, 0.0001, 400)
for (bat in nums) {
  print(bat)
}

chars <- c("a", "o", "u", "z")
for (bat in chars) {
  print(bat)
}
```

Of the most interest to us is changing what is within the `{}` or the operation we are performing on our data. We can insert anything we like in here.

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i^2)
  print(i+i-1)
}
```

Often we will want to keep the results we get back from our loop. We have two options, first one is to make a blank vector or data frame and append the results to it. This takes longer to run, which doesn't matter with simple loops but can get increase your wait times with longer and more complicated loop structures.

```{r}
x <- vector()         #makes a blank vector
for (i in 1:10) {
  y <- i^2            #performs an operation 
  x <- append(x,y)    #overwrites 'x' with y appended to it
}

x2 <- data.frame(col1=vector(), 
                 col2=vector())       #makes a blank data frame
for (i in 1:10) {
  col1 <- i^2                         #performs first operation
  col2 <- paste0("code",i)            #performs second operation 
  x2 <- rbind(x2, cbind(col1, col2))  #overwrites 'x2' values including the new row
}

```

The other option is to make a blank vector or dataframe of known dimensions and then place the results into it directly. 

```{r}
length(1:10)            #if we have 10 values of 'i' we need a vector with a length of 10
x <- vector(length=10)  #makes a blank vector with a length of 10
for (i in 1:10) {
  y <- i^2             
  x[i] <- y             #places the output in position i in the vector
}

x2 <- data.frame(col1=vector(length=10), 
                 col2=vector(length=10)) #makes a blank data frame with 10 rows
for (i in 1:10) {
  col1 <- i^2                            #performs first operation
  col2 <- paste0("code",i)               #performs second operation 
  x2[i,1] <- col1                        #places the first result into row i, column 1
  x2[i,2] <- col2                        #places the second result into row i, column 2
}
```

## An ecological example

Now we will use your new loop skills in an ecoogical context. As with the <span style="color:red">Subsetting rows and columns with dplyr</span> worksheet, we will use a dataset where bats were sampled across regrowth forest in south-eastern Australia which has been thinned to reduce the density of trees. For more details on this data, see the aforementioned worksheet.    

```{r}
bats = read.csv(file="bats.all.csv", header=T)
str(bats)
```

Having a look at the structure of this data, we have two response variables: activity (no. of bat calls recorded in a night) and foraging (no. of bat feeding calls recorded in a night). These data were collected over a total of 173 survey nights and at 47 different sites. There are eight potential predictor variables in the dataframe, one of which is a factor (treatment.thinned), and seven of which are continuous variables (area.thinned, time.since.thinned, exclusion.thinned, distance.murray.water, distance.creek.water, mean.T, mean.H). 

Let's say we are exploring our data and we would like to know how well bat activity (activity) correlates with our continuous covariates. We'd like to calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient for activity and each of the covariates separately. Pearson's correlation coefficient ranges from 0 (no correlation) to 1/-1 (perfectly positively/negatively correlated). We will build a dataframe where we can store our correlations. 

```{r}
bats.ss <- bats[,c(2,6:10,13:14)]          #gets the subset of data we are interested in, including our response (activity) and 7 predictor variables
rows <- ncol(bats.ss)-1                    #the number of rows needed in our output dataframe

output <- data.frame(variable=character(length=rows), 
                 correlation=numeric(length=rows), 
                 stringsAsFactors=F)       #makes a blank data frame with 10 rows
for (i in 1:rows) {
  temp1 <- colnames(bats.ss)[i+1]          #retrieves name of predictor variable
  temp2 <- cor(bats.ss[,1], bats.ss[,i+1], #calculates correlation between activity and predictor variable
               method="pearson")                            
  output[i,1] <- temp1                     #places the variable name into row i, column 1
  output[i,2] <- temp2                     #places the correlation into row i, column 2
}

output.sorted <- output[order(output$correlation),] #sorts the output table in order of correlation
```

Now we can see at a glance that activity is most strongly (negatively) correlated to area thinned and that it is not at all correlated to time since thinned or mean temperature. We might then like to further investigate some of these relationships with appropriate statistical models and tests.

## Using lists in loops

In the above example, we iterated between columns in a dataframe, using *i* to call in the column we were interested in. That can be a bit annoying to remember sometime, and there is a more flexible data structure in R called a list.  

A dataframe is a type of list, being a list of columns of the same length. However a list can be a list of any types of objects, for example we could make a list of a vector, a dataframe and a plot. We pull out items in the list using the double square brackets [[]]. 

```{r}
a <- 1:10                                               #creates a vector
b <- data.frame(x=a, y=floor(runif(5, min=0, max=10)))  #creates a dataframe
c <- plot(b, x~y)                                       #creates a plot
list1 <- list(a=a, b=b, c=c)                            #creates a list of the three objects
list1[[1]]                                              #the first item
list1$b                                                 #the second item (named 'b')
list1[[3]]                                              #the third item  
names(list)                                             #the names of list items
```

You can also make a list by splitting up a dataframe by based on one or more factors. For example, if we wanted to split up our data into four dataframes based on our four treatments (unthinned, short-term, medium-term, reference). 

```{r}
list2 <- split(x=bats, f=bats$treatment.thinned) 
names(list2)
head(list2[[4]])
```

Now we can use a loop to calculate some useful stats for each treatment.

```{r}
rows2 <- length(list2)
bat.activity.stats <- data.frame(mean=numeric(length=rows2),
                                 se=numeric(length=rows2),
                                 min=numeric(rows2),
                                 max=numeric(rows2),
                                 stringsAsFactors=F) 

for (i in 1:rows2) {
  bat.activity.stats[i,1] <- mean(list2[[i]][,2])
  bat.activity.stats[i,2] <- sd(list2[[i]][,2])/sqrt(length(list2[[i]][,2]))
  bat.activity.stats[i,3] <- min(list2[[i]][,2])
  bat.activity.stats[i,4] <- max(list2[[i]][,2])
}

print(bat.activity.stats)
```

## Using if/else statements in loops

With an *if* statement, we evaluate a statement and if it is true, it triggers an action, if it is false, then no action is triggered. See for example below, our variable *rows2* we used in the last example is equal to 4. In the example 1 we evauate the statement (rows2 = 4), as it is correct, we trigger the action within the {}, which is to print the text "CORRECT!". In the example 2 we supply an incorrect statement (rows2 = 8) which is found to be false, therefore triggering no action. In example 3, we add an *else* argument, which allows us to provide an alternative action for when the statement is untrue, in this case, printing "WRONG!".

```{r}
print(rows2)

if (rows2 == 4) {     #example 1
  print("CORRECT!")
}

if (rows2 == 8) {     #example 2
  print("CORRECT!")
}

if (rows2 == 8) {     #example 3
  print("CORRECT!")
} else {
  print("WRONG!")
}
```

Now let's put our lists, if/else statements and loops all together to learn more about our bat data. In our dataset we have collected the number of feeding calls (*foraging*) which indicates whether a bat is using an area to forage, rather than simply flying through. In this example, we are interested in the sites where bats foraged more than 5 times during any given night sampled. We want to look at the enviromental covariates for these sites to see if there is anything special about them. 

```{r}
bats.sites <- split(x=bats, f=bats$site)
rows3 <- length(bats.sites)
foraging.output <- data.frame(foraging=character(length=rows3),
                              area.thinned=numeric(length=rows3),
                              time.since.thinned=numeric(length=rows3),
                              exclusion.thinned=numeric(length=rows3),
                              distance.murray.water=numeric(length=rows3),
                              distance.creek.water=numeric(length=rows3),
                              mean.T=numeric(length=rows3),
                              mean.H=numeric(length=rows3),
                              stringsAsFactors=F)

for (i in 1:rows3) {
  temp <- bats.sites[[i]][,3]
    if (min(temp) >=5) {
      foraging.output[i,1] <- "high foraging"
    } else {
      (foraging.output[i,1] <- "low foraging")
    } 
  foraging.output[i,2:8] <-colMeans(bats.sites[[i]][,c(6:10,13:14)])
}

foraging.sorted <- foraging.output[order(foraging.output$foraging),]
foraging.sorted[1:10,]       #prints the first 10 rows of our output dataframe
```

Now we have a list of sites we have identified as consistently high foraging sites, we can look at the differences between the environmental variables, for example, we could make boxplots of the different environmental variables in high foraging and low foraging sites. Hopefully you now have enough knowledge to make your own loops to suit your own research requirements - good luck!

## Further help

You can find some more good examples of loops, lists and if/else statements on the BEES R User group GitHub site [loops and lists by Mitch](https://github.com/mitchest/BEES-ecocomp/blob/master/introToLoops.R). It's also worth checking out the scripts and example data from other BEES R User group meetings that cover a range of topics [here](https://github.com/mitchest/BEES-ecocomp).
