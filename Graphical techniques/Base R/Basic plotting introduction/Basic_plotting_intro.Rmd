R has a very wide range of functions and packages for visualising data. Here is some help for some very simple plots using the base functions in R for data with:  

* [one continuous variable](http://environmentalcomputing.net/one-continuous-variable/) - histograms and box plots  
* [two continuous variables](http://environmentalcomputing.net/two-continuous-variables/) - scatter plots  
* [one continuous vs categorical variables](http://environmentalcomputing.net/single-continuous-vs-categorical-variables/) - box plots and bar plots
