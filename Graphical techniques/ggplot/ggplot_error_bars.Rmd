Bar plots with error bars are very frequently used in the environmental sciences to contrast a continuous variable across levels of one or more categorical variables. These are not always straightforward to make with the base functions in R. This page introduces you to making these plots with the package ggplot2.

Before you get started, read the page on the [basics](http://environmentalcomputing.net/plotting-with-ggplot-the-basics/) of plotting with ggplot and install the package ggplot2.

```{r,warning=F}
library(ggplot2)
```

In this examples, let's use a data set that is already in R with the length and width of floral parts for three species of iris. First, load the data set:

```{r}
data(iris)
```

To contrast a variable across species, we first need to summarise the data to obtain means and a measure of variation for each of the three species in the data set. There are several ways to do this in R, but we like the `summarise` and `group_by` functions in the package [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html). See [here](http://environmentalcomputing.net/summarising-data/
) for more details on using dplyr for summarising data.

The following code will make a new data frame with the summary data per species.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
library(dplyr)

Iris_summary <- iris %>% # the names of the new data frame and the data frame to be summarised
  group_by(Species) %>%   # the grouping variable
  summarise(mean_PL = mean(Petal.Length),  # calculates the mean of each group
            sd_PL = sd(Petal.Length), # calculates the standard deviation of each group
            n_PL = n(),  # calculates the sample size per group
            SE_PL = sd(Petal.Length)/sqrt(n())) # calculates the standard error of each group
```

We can now make a bar plot of means vs species, with standard deviations or standard errors as the error bar. The following code uses the standard deviations.

```{r}
IrisPlot <- ggplot(Iris_summary, aes(Species, mean_PL)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_PL-sd_PL, ymax=mean_PL+sd_PL),width=0.2)

print(IrisPlot + labs(y="Petal length (cm) ± s.d.", x = "Species") + theme_classic())
```


In the `geom_bar` code, `stat="identity"` tells ggplot to use the value of the y variable (mean_PL) as the height of the bars. Otherwise, the default is `stat_bin`, which counts the number of values.

In the `geom_errorbar` code, `ymin` and `ymax` are the top and bottom of the error bars (defined here as mean +/- sd), and `width` defines how wide the error bars are.
