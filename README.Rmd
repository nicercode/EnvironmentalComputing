The goal of **Environmental Computing** is to provide accessible coding and statistical tutorials to R users. If you would like to learn more about this site, click [here](https://environmentalcomputing.net/about-this-site/)

This repository contains the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) backbone to build and maintain the website. Below are important details to quickly orientate you to the behind-the-scenes of this website

### Installation of `blogdown` and Hugo

`blogdown` is a R interface to Hugo  and is super handy for our purposes as most tutorials are written as R Markdown files which is rendered into a Hugo-friendly format. 

Blogdown can be installed from either CRAN or directly from the RStudio `blogdown` Github repository using the `remotes` package:

```{r, blogdown}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("blogdown")

# Install from Github
remotes::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')

library(blogdown)
```

Once blogdown is installed, we can use this package to install Hugo!

```{r hugo}
blogdown::install_hugo()
```

If you have older versions of Hugo on your computer or having issues installing Hugo via blogdown you may want to run:

```{r, hugo trouble}
# Search for where Hugo was previously installed, option to remove previous versions
blogdown::find_hugo() 

# Having issues with Hugo? Try using this handy function!
blogdown::check_hugo()
```

### Install dependencies 

Once you have `blogdown` and Hugo installed, you will want to make sure you have all the different packages that were used in the tutorials. We created a `DESCRIPTION` file which lists out all the current dependencies under `Imports`. As the website continues to grow, you will need to manually edit the `DESCRIPTION` file to ensure the dependencies match accordingly! Please make sure the dependencies are listed in **alphabetical order**. 

To install the dependencies listed in the `DESCRIPTION` file

```{r, depend}
remotes::install_deps()
```

### Structure of the major directories 

The most important directories for the website are `content/`,  `static/` and  `public/`.

Briefly:

- `content/` is  the backend of the website and is where you will be working in the most. This is where all the .Rmd files for each tutorial are kept. 
- `static/` is where the [theme](https://learn.netlify.app/en/) of the website lives. Hugo translates the websites content into static files. 
- These are automatically copied into the `public/` directory each thing Hugo renders the website. You don't know need to physically edit the items in `public/`. 

For more info about these directories see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/hugo.html)

### Name and code style conventions

Please follow these conventions when creating new folders: 

- lowercase names
- use `-` hypthens to join separate words and numbers e.g. `meta-analysis-1`
- if possible, keep folder names to less than 3 concise words 
- use commonly used abbreviations e.g. `glms` instead of `generalised-linear-models`
- If there are multiple tutorials for a given topic, use numbers beginning from 1 e.g. `mixed-model-1`

We used the `styler` package to format all the content within each .Rmd

```{r, eval=F}
# An example

styler::style_file("content/Data-Manipulation/combining-datasets/_index.Rmd")
```

### The anatomy of nested menus

All of our tutorials are organised into major menus (`coding-skills/`, `statistics/`, `graphics/` etc). Sub-menus are created by putting a folder within the main folder e.g. `asking-code-questions/` is a subfolder within `coding-skills/`. Any files (.Rmd, .html and images) associated with the subtopic will live in that subfolder e.g. _index.rmd, stack.png

```
content/
├── about-this-site
├── coding-skills
│   ├── asking-code-questions
│   │   ├── _index.html
│   │   ├── _index.rmd
│   │   ├── stack.png
│   ├── good-practice
```

#### The order of menus

Each folder contains a `_index.rmd` which creates its associated `_index.html` file. It is crucial to set this file up correctly to organise the menu and pages. The yaml header of each `_index.rmd` file looks a bit like this. The yaml section controls the order of the pages. 

```
---
title: "Getting Started with R"
output: html_document
weight: 2
---
```

- The `title:` parameter becomes the name of the menu. Note that each word in `title:` is **capitalised**
- The `weight:` parameter denotes the **order** of the page. 1 being the first, 2 being the second and so forth. 
- The `output:` parameter determines what format the .Rmd is rendered to. For Hugo's sake, we need it to render the .Rmd into a `html_document`.

In the yaml example above, the `weight:` parameter is 2, notice that the second menu on the [website](environmentalcomputing.net) is "Getting Started in R". 

Once you enter a menu e.g. "Getting Started in R", the sequence for the `weight:` restarts so that you can set the order for subtopics within "Getting Started in R". 

For example, `weight: 1` for "Installing R and RStudio", `weight: 2` for "Using R Notebooks" and so forth.

I recommend taking a look at this [website](https://mingchen0919.github.io/blogdown-website-with-hugo-theme-learn/) to better understand the nestedness of the menus and how to set this up using subfolders and `_index.Rmd` files.

### Working with git

The recommended workflow with git

1. **PULL** down remote changes at the beginning of your work session. 
2. Proceed to work on the files for the website
3. **STAGE** your changes (In RStudio, check the box next to file)
4. **COMMIT** your changes. Generally, I make a commit for changes that is related e.g. all in the same file or directory. That way the changes are grouped together with one informative message. 
5. **PUSH** your committed changes. 

Note: Should a merge conflict arise, reach out of one of the maintainers and we can help ya out

### Creating a new page

So you want to make a tutorial!? Here's my recommended workflow for creating a brand-spanking-new page! 

1. Decide where the new page should live within the existing menu structure. e.g. Coding skill? Graphics/ggplot? etc
2. Create a new folder in the desired location and name it following conventions above. 
3. Enter the new folder you created
4. Create a new .Rmd file and name it `_index.Rmd`
5. Copy and paste the yaml template at the top of the file and edit accordingly. 

```
---
title: "Title of your new tutorial
output: html_document
weight: 
---
```

- Remember the `weight:` denotes the **order** of the page, so change this according to the existing page order. I recommend opening the website in a browser and counting the number of menu items to determine what `weight:`you want your new page to be. 
- If you need to slot the new page in between existing pages, you will need to update the  `weight:` for the pages that comes AFTER your new page. 

6. Proceed with writing your page like any .Rmd file

### Building the site

Once you are happy with the format of a new page/updates you've made, use the following functions to render your page. **Knitting and saving your .Rmd** will also do the trick!

```{r}
blogdown::build_site(build_rmd = 'newfile')

# and then to preview your site, open in browser and explore your work :) 
blogdown::serve_site()
```

Occasionally, you will want to make edits to multiple .Rmds, to re-render these pages use:

```{r}
blogdown::build_site(build_rmd = 'timestamp')
```

If you want to re-render a specific .Rmd, without rebuilding the entire site: 

```{r}
blogdown::build_site(build_rmd = "file/path/to/RMD")
```

Sometimes, you'll notice that despite knitting or using the above functions, your page is not showing up. This is where the following function comes in handy:

```{r}
blogdown::check_site()

# There are various blogdown::check_ functions, check_site() does it all-in-one
```

This function will prompt to you fix your issues, usually you will need to remove incompatible files, restart RStudio and use  `blogdown::build_site(build_rmd = 'newfile')` again. No worries! 

If you are already previewing your site, you will notice upon saving your .Rmd, the site will usually dynamically  update itself but its good practice to occasionally use the above `blogdown::build_site()` functions to ensure proper rendering. 

To stop previewing the site: 

```{r}
blogdown::stop_server()
```

### Internal links

In some tutorials there are references to other pages on the website. For example, the [Statistics page](environmentalcomputing.net/statistics) provides links to all the subtopics under "Statistics". Please follow these conventions when adding internal links in your .rmd 

Lets say you are working on a page under `data-manipulation/` and you want to reference to a page under `graphics/`. In this circumstance, you are linking to an entirely different major menu, so we recommend using **absolute paths**. This is denoted by the `/` preceding `statistics/` which searches for a folder in the entire project directory named `statistics`

For example:

```
Once you have summarised your data, you can easily [plot it!]("/statistics/graphics/ggplot")
```

Alternatively, if you are working of a page within the same menu e.g. `data-manipulation/subsetting-data` and want to reference a page within the same menu e.g. `data-manipulation/combining-datasets`, we recommend using **relative paths**. This is denoted by the `..` preceding `/combining-datasets`. The `..` means 'going up a directory level' and then `/combining-datasets` means going into the `combining-datasets` subfolder. 

Like this:

```
You can [merge]("../combining-datasets") your newly subsetted data to another dataframe.
```

### Aliases 

[Aliases](https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#example-aliases) help redirect existing, outdated or alternative URLs to specific pages oxsn the website. Aliases were particularly useful when we were reorganising old tutorial pages to the new blogdown/Hugo system. For example, in the first generation of the website the URL for the 'Asking Code Questions' page was accessed using:

```
environmentalcomputing.net/asking-coding-questions/ # OLD
```

In the new generation of the website the same 'Asking Code Questions' page is accessed via:

```
environmentalcomputing.net/coding-skills/asking-coding-questions/ # NEW
```
We created an aliases so that the old URL can still work and direct to the new site. This can be achieved by simply adding an `aliases:` parameter in the yaml in the .Rmd
```
---
title: "Asking Code Questions"
output: html_document
aliases: /asking-coding-questions/
weight: 5
---
```
