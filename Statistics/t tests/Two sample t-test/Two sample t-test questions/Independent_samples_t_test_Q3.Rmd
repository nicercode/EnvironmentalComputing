An environmental scientist was interested in how land management affected water quality in rivers. She compared the salinity of 10 rivers in areas of farmland to 10 rivers in forested areas and received the following data (measured as EC, electrical conductivity):

Landscape EC
Forest  307
Forest	298
Forest	478
Forest	687
Forest	523
Forest	380
Forest	475
Forest	463
Forest	391
Forest	370
Farmland	850
Farmland	551
Farmland	639
Farmland	567
Farmland	403
Farmland	578
Farmland	601
Farmland	490
Farmland	647
Farmland	612



```{r}
RiverEC = read.csv(file = "RiverEC.csv", header = T)

```

Firstly, visualise the differences in electrical conductivity abundance between the two types of rivers.

```{r}
boxplot(EC~Landscape, data = RiverEC)
```


**A)** What statistical test would be suitable to contrast the salinity between the two types of rivers?

```{r}
# {1:MULTICHOICE:=Two sample t test~Contingency table~Goodness of fit test~Paired t test}
```



**B)** After checking the assumptions of your test, conduct the test, and give the value of the test statistic and P value.

```{r}
hist(RiverEC$EC)

t.test(EC~Landscape, data = RiverEC)

```

**C)** Is there any evidence that salinity varied between the rivers in farmland and forest?


```{r}
# {1:MULTICHOICE:=Yes~No}
```


Samples were also classified into those that were above or below the limit recommended by the World Health Organisation for drinking water (EC= 800). 

**Q4** What analysis could you use to test the whether the 20 samples differed from previous sampling in the same area that had found 40% of samples unsuitable for drinking?

```{r}
#{1:MULTICHOICE:=Goodness of fit test~Two sample t test~Contingency table~~Paired t test}
sum(RiverEC$EC >= 800) # Counts how many observation over 800
chisq.test(x=c(1,19),p=c(0.4,0.6))

```

**E)** Present the value of the test statistic chosen and state whether the null hypothesis is rejected or retained.

```{r}
# {1:MULTICHOICE:=Rejected~Retained}
```
