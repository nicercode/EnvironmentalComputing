<p>This site integrates different techniques used by researchers and postgraduates at the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/">University of New South Wales, Australia</a>, who have provided their knowledge and skills to assist others develop skills for rigorous environmental science.</p>
<p>Some resources were developed initially to assist with teaching quantitative skills to undergraduate and postgraduate students in the <a href="http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/">School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences</a> at the University of New South Wales, supported by a Learning and Teaching Innovation Grant to Associate Professor Alistair Poore, Dr Will Cornwell, Professor Iain Suthers and Professor Richard Kingsford.</p>
