```{r,echo=F,fig.width=6, fig.height=2.5}
Plant_height <- read.csv(file = "data/Plant_Height.csv", header = TRUE)

par(mfrow = c(1, 3))

hist(Plant_height$height, main = NULL, xlab = "Plant heigth (cm)", col = "red")

model <- lm(loght ~ temp, data = Plant_height)
plot(loght ~ temp, data = Plant_height, xlab = "Temperature (C)", ylab = "log(Plant height)", pch = 16, col = "darkgreen")
abline(model, col = "red")

boxplot(loght ~ hemisphere, data = Plant_height, ylab = "log(Plant height)", xlab = "Hemisphere", names = c("South", "North"), col = "lightblue")
```

R has a very wide range of functions and packages for visualising data. Here is some help for some very simple plots using the base functions in R for data with:  

* [one continuous variable](/graphics/basic-plotting/one-continuous/) - histograms and box plots  
* [two continuous variables](/graphics/basic-plotting/two-continuous/) - scatter plots  
* [one continuous vs categorical variables](/graphics/basic-plotting/one-continuous-one-factor/) - box plots and bar plots
