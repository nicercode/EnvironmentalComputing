<p><a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> is a powerful graphing package in R that can be used to create professional looking plot for reports, essays or papers. It can create a variety of plots including boxplots, scatterpots and histograms and they can be highly customised to suit your data.</p>
<p>The package is named after a book called <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books/about/The_Grammar_of_Graphics.html?id=ZiwLCAAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_cover&amp;hl=en">The Grammar of Graphics</a> about how to effectively communicate data graphically.</p>
<p>Start with the <a href="/../plotting-with-ggplot-the-basics/">basics</a> to learn the basic syntax of making a graph</p>
<p>Then, visit our other pages to further customise the aesthetics of the graph, including colour and formatting:<br />
