[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) is a powerful graphing package in R that can be used to create professional looking plot for reports, essays or papers. It can create a variety of plots including boxplots, scatterpots and histograms and they can be highly customised to suit your data. 

The package is named after a book called [The Grammar of Graphics](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/The_Grammar_of_Graphics.html?id=ZiwLCAAAQBAJ&source=kp_cover&hl=en) about how to effectively communicate data graphically. 
  


Start with the [basics](/graphics/ggplot/ggplot-basics) to learn the basic syntax of making a graph

Then, visit our other pages to further customise the aesthetics of the graph, including colour and formatting:  
* [altering the overall appearance](/graphics/ggplot/ggplot-appearance/)  
* [adding titles and axis names](/graphics/ggplot/ggplot-labels/)  
* [colours and symbols](/graphics/ggplot/ggplot-colour-shapes/).   

Help on all the ggplot functions can be found at the [The master ggplot help site](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).

A useful cheat sheet on commonly used functions can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf).
