```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=F}
library(ggplot2)
g1 <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, colour=Species)) + geom_point() +theme_classic()
print(g1 + labs(y="Petal length (cm)", x = "Sepal length (cm)"))
```
 

### Creating a ggplot
 
First, you will need to install the package ggplot2 on your machine, then load the package with the usual `library` function.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

The starting point for creating a plot is to use the `ggplot` function with the following basic structure:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
plot1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x variable, y variable)) + geom_graph.type()

print(plot1)
```

`data` is a data frame that holds the variables that you would like to plot.

`aes` specifies which variables to plot. This code commonly causes confusion when creating ggplots. While `aes` stands for aesthetics, in ggplot it does not relate to the visual look of the graph but rather what data you want to see in the graph. It specifies what the graph presents rather than how it is presented.

`+ geom_graph.type` specifies what sort of plot you want to make. ggplot will not work unless you have this added on. You don't actually type 'graph.type()', but choose one of the types of graph.

Commonly used examples include:  
* scatterplot - `+ geom_point()`  
* boxplot - `+ geom_boxplot()`  
* histogram - `+ geom_histogram()`  
* bar plot - `+ geom_bar()`  

Ensure there is a open and closed bracket after the `geom` code. This tells R to make the graph with the basic standard formatting for this graph type.

The type of graph you want to make has to match the classes of the inputs. For example, a scatterplot would require both variables to be numeric. Or a boxplot would require the *x* variable to be a factor and the *y* variable to be numeric. You can check the class of any variable with the `class` function, or all variables in a data frame with the `str` function.

A helpful practise when making ggplots is to assign the plot you've made to an object (e.g., plot1 in the code above) and then 'print' it separately. As your ggplot becomes more complicated this will make it much easier. 
  

### Example plots
 
![](ggplot1_basics_image.jpg)

In these examples, let's use a data set that is already in R with the length and width of floral parts for three species of iris. First, load the data set:

```{r}
data(iris)
```

To contrast petal length across the three species of iris with a **box plot**, we would use:

```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(iris, aes(Species, Petal.Length)) + geom_boxplot()
print(plot1)
```

Note how `aes` included the *x* then the *y* variables which you wanted to plot, and that `+ geom_boxplot()` specified a boxplot.

To plot a **frequency histogram** of petal length, we would use:

```{r, message=F}
plot2 <- ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length)) + geom_histogram()
print(plot2)
```

To use a **scatter plot** the visualise the relationship between petal length and sepal length, we would use:

```{r}
plot3 <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)) + geom_point()
print(plot3)
```

These points could then be coloured according to the levels of a categorical variable. To do this, add `colour="categorical.variable"` in the `aes` brackets. To colour by species, we would use:

```{r}
plot4 <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, colour=Species)) + geom_point()
print(plot4)
```
  

### Adding a basic theme
 
The overall look of the ggplot can be altered with different set themes. This can be done by adding `+ theme_bw()` or `+ theme_classic()` to the end of your line of code. Like `geom()`, ensure there is open and closed brackets after the theme name.

```{r}
plot5 <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, colour=Species)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()
print(plot5)

plot6<-ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, colour=Species)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
print(plot6)
```
