These pages have some introductions to a wide range of commonly used statistical analyses in the environmental sciences.

Some simple [hypothesis tests](t-tests) with the *t* statistic:

* [One sample t tests](t-tests/one-sample-t-test) - contrasting a single sample parameter to a population parameter  
* [Independent samples](t-tests/two-sample-t-test) - contrasting the means of two samples
* [Paired t-tests](t-tests/paired-t-test) - contrasting two groups when data are paired  

[Linear models](linear-models):

* [Linear regression](linear-models/linear-regression)
* [Analysis of variance: single factor](linear-models/anova/anova-single/)
* [Analysis of variance: factorial](linear-models/anova/anova-factorial/)  
* [Understanding interactions](linear-models/interactions)
