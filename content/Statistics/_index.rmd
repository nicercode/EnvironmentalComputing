These pages have some introductions to a wide range of commonly used statistical analyses in the environmental sciences.

Some simple [hypothesis tests](/../t-tests/) with the *t* statistic:

* [One sample t tests](/../one-sample-t-test/) - contrasting a single sample parameter to a population parameter  
* [Independent samples](/../independent-samples-t-test/) - contrasting the means of two samples
* [Paired t-tests](/../paired-t-tests/) - contrasting two groups when data are paired  

[Linear models](/../linear-models/):

* [Linear regression](/../linear-regression/)
* [Analysis of variance: single factor](/../analysis-variance-single-factor/)
* [Analysis of variance: factorial](/../analysis-variance-factorial/)  
* [Understanding interactions](/../understanding-interactions/)

[Generalised linear models](/../generalised-linear-models/):

* [Generalised linear models 1](/../generalised-linear-models-1/): Introduction and binomial data  
* [Generalised linear models 2](/../generalised-linear-models-2/): Count data  

[Mixed models](/../mixed-models/):

* [Mixed models 1](/../mixed-models-1/): Linear mixed models with one random effect  
* [Mixed models 2](/../mixed-models-2/): Linear mixed models with several random effects
