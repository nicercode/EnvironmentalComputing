<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is one of the most frequently used techniques in the biological and environmental sciences. ANOVA is used to contrast a continuous dependent variable <em>y</em> across levels of one or more categorical independent variables <em>x</em>. The independent variables are termed the factor or treatment, and the various categories within that treatment are termed the levels. In this module, we will start with the simplest design - those with a single factor.</p>
<p>Where an independent samples <em>t</em>-test would be used for comparison of group means across two levels, ANOVA is used for the comparison of &gt;2 group means, or when there are more than two or more predictor variables (see <a href="/statistics/linear-models/anova/anova-factorial">ANOVA: factorial</a>). The logic of this test is essentially the same as the <em>t</em>-test - it compares variation between groups to variation within groups to determine whether the observed differences are due to chance or not.</p>
