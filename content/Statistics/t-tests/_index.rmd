Some simple hypothesis tests with the t statistic:

* [One sample t tests](one-sample-t-test) to contrasting a single sample parameter to a population parameter  
* [Independent samples](two-sample-t-test) t tests to contrast the means of two samples
* [Paired t-tests](paired-t-test) to contrast two groups of values where each pair is measured from the same object.
