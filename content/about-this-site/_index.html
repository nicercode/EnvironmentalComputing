<p>This site is a brief introduction to techniques for data organisation, graphics, and analyses, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to organise your data during <a href="/getting-started-with-r/data-entry/">data entry</a></li>
<li>how to <a href="/data-manipulation/">manipulate and manage your data</a> so there is transparency and version control</li>
<li>instructions for running <a href="/statistics/">statistical analyses</a> with sample code in R or other relevant software (first see <a href="/getting-started-with-r/">Getting started with R</a>)</li>
<li>the rationale for the technique in plain language (why is it used)</li>
<li>how to interpret the results and assumptions that you need to check</li>
<li><a href="/graphics/">visualisation</a> of your results and ways to effectively communicate the results in scientific reports or publications</li>
<li>where to go for further help</li>
</ul>
<p>This site integrates different techniques used by researchers and postgraduates at the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/">University of New South Wales, Australia</a>, who have provided their knowledge and skills to assist others develop skills for rigorous environmental science.</p>
<p>Resources were developed initially to assist with teaching quantitative skills to undergraduate and postgraduate students in the <a href="http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/">School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences</a> at the University of New South Wales, supported by a Learning and Teaching Innovation Grant to Alistair Poore, Will Cornwell, Iain Suthers and Richard Kingsford. Development of the second generation of this site was possible through the support of the <a href="http://www.eerc.unsw.edu.au/">Evolution and Ecology Research Centre</a>.</p>
