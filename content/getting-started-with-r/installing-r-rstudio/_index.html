We recommend using R Studio as a user friendly interface for using R.</p>
<p>First, install the latest version of <strong>R</strong> - download from <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/">here</a>
Second, install the latest version of <strong>R Studio</strong> - download from <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">here</a></p>

<h3>Setting the working directory</h3>
<p>Once you have installed R and R Studio, you need to set the working directory. This is the location on your computer where any data files to imported can be found, and where any R scripts (the files that save your code) will be saved.</p>
<p>In R studio, you can set the working directory with the menus (<em>Session &gt;&gt; Set Working Directory &gt;&gt; Choose Directory</em>) or with a line of code that gives the path of the folder on your computer:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setwd(&quot;Drive:/Folder1/Folder2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>If you are working with any of the example data files on this site, you will first need to download them to a folder on your computer and specify that folder as the working directory.</p>

<h3>The layout of R Studio</h3>
<p><img src="Installing_R_and_R_Studio_image.jpg" /></p>
<p>R Studio has four panels:</p>
<p>The top left panel is the editor (or script window) you can view your R script. Running code from here is a simple as Ctrl+Enter when the cursor is on the line or lines of code that you want to execute.</p>
<p>The bottom left panel is the console (or command window) where you can also run lines of code (write code next to &gt; and press Enter), but also where any text or numerical output will appear.</p>
<p>The top right is the workspace window that lists the various R objects that you are currently using. These can be data sets or objects created by various analyses.</p>
<p>The panel on the bottom right has:
<em>lists of the files in your working directory
</em>the R packages that you are currently using
<em>any graphical output in the Plots window
</em>help files (accessed by ? preceding any bit of code)</p>
<p>You can change the size of these by dragging the edges of the windows.</p>
</div>
<div id="saving-your-code-in-a-script" class="section level3">
<h3>Saving your code in a script</h3>
<p>You should save all the code you use for a given analysis or graphic. Use the menus in R Studio to create a new R script (<em>File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; R script</em>) and save that with the disk icon or menu (<em>File &gt;&gt; Save</em>). See <a href="../project-management/">Project management</a> for advice on how to structure these files.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-r-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Installing R packages</h3>
<p>If your required analyses or graphics need a package that is not in the initial installation of R, then new packages can be installed from the menus (<em>Tools &gt;&gt; Install packages</em>) or from the panel on the bottom right. Once installed, they can be loaded with the <code>library</code> function (recommended) or by ticking the little box next to the package name (not recommended). It is better practice to use the <code>library</code> function in your script as that will remind you what packages need to be loaded.</p>
<p>For example, this code will load the package <code>maptools</code> if it is installed on your computer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(maptools)</code></pre>
